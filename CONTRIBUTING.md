We love contributions and the best way to do it is via pull requests. 

Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Verify that your contribution is working as expected, preferably, but not mandatory, with a writen test.

3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not accept, pull requests within a week.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted

* Update the documentation, including the API documentation and whatever is affected by your contribution.
* Comment your pull request with clear explanation of what your contribution will accomplish.

Syntax:

* Two spaces, no tabs.
* No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any space.
* Follow the conventions you see used in the source already.

Thanks a million! We are looking forward to see your contribution!
